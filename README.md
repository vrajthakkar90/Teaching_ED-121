# Teaching_ED-121
Here are the assignments and other files I created for Engineering Mathematics 2 (ED 121) as a teaching assistant with help of Prof. Prosenjit Kundu and Riyanka Jena(Co-TA). The modules for this course were probability, statistics and information theory. There was also a small project in the course so that the students could appericiate and learn to implement the concepts taught in the course.
